# Deposits

AnyCoins provides a streamlined deposit process through two distinct workflows to accommodate different merchant needs: Flexible Amount Deposit and Payment Form Deposit. These workflows are meticulously designed to facilitate a straightforward deposit experience, thus empowering merchants with the flexibility and ease required to handle cryptocurrency transactions.

## Flexible Amount Deposit

The Flexible Amount Deposit workflow is engineered for scenarios where the deposit amount isn't predetermined. It's especially suitable for merchants who wish to provide a deposit address to their customers for payments, donations, or other transaction types where the exact amount isn't fixed. Here’s how it operates:

1. **Request Deposit Address**:

   - Initiate a request via the AnyCoins platform to obtain a deposit address.
   - AnyCoins will generate a unique cryptocurrency wallet address for your customers' deposits.

2. **Customer Sends Cryptocurrency**:

   - Share the provided wallet address with your customers.
   - Your customers can now send any amount of cryptocurrency to this address, provided it exceeds the minimum deposit requirement of approximately $5.

3. **Transaction Confirmation**:

   - Upon network confirmation, AnyCoins processes the deposit.
   - You will receive a notification confirming the receipt and processing of each deposit.

4. **Account Credit**:
   - The deposited amount, after the network fee is deducted, will be credited to your AnyCoins account.
   - You can now manage these funds as per your business needs within the AnyCoins platform.

## Payment Form Deposit

The Payment Form Deposit workflow is crafted for e-commerce transactions where a precise amount is due. This method ensures that the exact amount is deposited for each transaction. Here’s how it unfolds:

1. **Payment Form Generation**:

   - Specify the exact amount due for the order and initiate the Deposit process using our API. You will get the URL of the oayment form in a response.
   - The payment form will display the cryptocurrency amount required to complete the transaction.

2. **Customer Completes Payment**:

   - Your customers sees the payment form and submit the cryptocurrency payment.

3. **Transaction Confirmation**:

   - Upon network confirmation, AnyCoins processes the payment.
   - You will receive a notification confirming the receipt and processing of the payment.

4. **Merchant Account Credit and Order Confirmation**:
   - The payment amount, after the network fee is deducted, will be credited to your AnyCoins account.
   - The order status is updated to confirmed, allowing you to proceed with order fulfillment.

Both deposit workflows are aimed at providing a seamless, merchant-centric experience, ensuring smooth and secure transactions on the AnyCoins platform.
