# Terms and Definitions

Understanding the world of cryptocurrency transactions requires getting familiar with specialized terms to fully grasp the processes and players involved. Whether you're a merchant, a developer, or a customer, knowing these terms is crucial for clear communication and smooth interaction with the AnyCoins platform's functionalities.

- **Merchant** --- A business entity or individual engaged in the sale of goods or services. Merchants can utilize AnyCoins processing to manage transactions with customers.
- **Customer** --- An individual or entity procuring goods or services from a merchant.
- **AnyCoins Processing** --- A specialized service provided by AnyCoins to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions between merchants and customers.
- **Deposit** --- The process of transferring cryptocurrency from a customer to a merchant.
- **Withdrawal** --- The process of transferring cryptocurrency from a AnyCoins merchant account to a customer's wallet address or any external wallet address.
- **Network Fee** --- A fee incurred for processing a cryptocurrency transaction on the network (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), typically to compensate miners or validators on the network.

In the context of AnyCoins, the Network Fee for incoming transactions can be paid by the Customer or absorbed by the Merchant. Initially, the Network Fee is designated to be paid by the Customer.

<div class="warning">
The precise Network Fee charged will vary according to the network type and its current conditions.

AnyCoins does not control the Network Fee, and it is subject to change without notice.

- **Processing Fee** --- A fee imposed by AnyCoins to facilitate a transaction between a merchant and a customer.There is no fee charged for withdrawals. The fee amount is contingent on the merchant's monthly transaction volume, with the potential for lower fees at higher transaction volumes.
- **Webhook** --- A mechanism allowing one system to provide real-time data to another system immediately once an event occurs. Within AnyCoins, webhooks might be employed to alert a merchant of a completed transaction.
- **Wallet Address** --- A unique identifier analogous to a bank account number in traditional finance, representing a destination for cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Hot Wallet** --- A cryptocurrency wallet connected to the internet, allowing for immediate transactions and ensuring a seamless flow of operations. AnyCoins uses hot wallets to receive crypto from customers and process withdrawals.
- **Cold Wallet** --- A cryptocurrency wallet disconnected from the internet, offering heightened security against online threats but with reduced transactional convenience. We use cold wallets to store consolidated crypto for long-term safekeeping.
- **Consolidation** --- The process of gathering funds from operational hot wallets and moving them into one cold wallet to keep funds organized and secure.
- **Coin** --- The native digital currency of its own blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
- **Token** --- A digital unit created on a blockchain, representing various values or holdings, often used for accessing particular applications or services within a blockchain ecosystem. Unlike a coin, which is a native digital currency of its own blockchain, a token operates on an existing blockchain and has a wider range of purposes or representations.

AnyCoins supports multiple coins and tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tether. We are continually expanding our supported assets to provide more options for our merchants and customers. You can find the full list of supported assets [here](./supported-assets.md).

- **Blockchain** --- A decentralized, distributed digital ledger employed to record transactions across numerous computers, ensuring the immutability of records without retroactive alteration unless all subsequent blocks are altered.
- **Cryptocurrency** --- A digital or virtual currency utilizing cryptography for security, operating autonomously of a central authority.
- **API (Application Programming Interface)** --- A defined set of rules and tools enabling different software applications to communicate with each other.
